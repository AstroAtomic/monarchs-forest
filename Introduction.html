    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<section>
<section>
  <h2>What type of campaign is this?</h2>
  <p>
    This is a horror-themed campaign with elements inspired by SCP and dark fantasy. While the tone will often be serious, moments of light-heartedness and humor are expected to break the tension and create balance. 
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Expectations</h2>
  <p>
    This is a story-focused campaign that encourages roleplaying and immersion. Players will be given enough information to make their own decisions about where to go, what to do, and how to act in the world. There is no strict path — your actions shape the direction of the story.<br/><br/>
    The campaign unfolds gradually, with players uncovering the deeper narrative through exploration and choices. Collaboration and creativity are key. This is less like a video game and more like a shared story where you control your character, and the world reacts accordingly.

  <h2>The Basic Story</h2>
  <p>
    [IMPERIAL DOSSIER 7A-44/BETA — CLASSIFIED - RANGER DEPLOYMENT: STARLING DISTRICT]<br/><br/>
    Following public circulation of a seemingly generic imperial notice regarding "Ranger Opportunities" in the Starling District, an abnormally high compensation range raised attention among independent operatives and mercenary groups. You — along with a few select applicants — passed through multiple layers of vetting, including formal interviews and non-disclosed background inquiries.<br/><br/>
    You have been **accepted** into the program.<br/><br/>
    Official travel orders have now been issued. You are en route to the **Capital City of Elanora**, where your presence has been requested at the **Royal Administration Building**. There, you will report to a man known only as **Sam** — an agent operating within the administrative core. The nature of your assignment has not been disclosed. All communications moving forward will occur on-site under sealed protocol.<br/><br/>
    Note: The unusually generous payment package implies the presence of covert operations, instability, or undisclosed threats in the target region. Caution is advised.<br/><br/>

  <h2>Character Creation</h2>
  <p>
    When creating your character, keep the campaign setting in mind. Why was your character selected for this high-paying imperial position? What experience or background made them qualified? Why did they choose to leave their old life behind and take this job?<br/><br/>
    This is a horror-themed story, so extremely overpowered or exaggerated builds (like a level 5 paladin with the power of a thousand suns) may not fit the tone of the game. Characters with flaws, depth, and purpose will feel more grounded in the world.<br/><br/>
    Homebrew content is welcome and even encouraged in some cases. For example, if you’re playing a paladin or wizard, feel free to adapt their abilities to fit a nature-based theme or use homebrew material that suits the setting.<br/><br/>
    Most non-human races (other than humans, dwarves, and high elves) are rare in the Starling District. If you’re playing a rare race, you’re invited to create your own lore, culture, and place of origin. The wider world beyond Starling is flexible. 
    You may also come from inside starling district but you will be asked to have a one on one with me because you would know more than the rest.
